Code for the first coursework of the 2023 Game Theory Course. 

In this, we looked at ways to plot payoffs (seen in ```PayoffPlotter```). We then looked in more detail at the election game, in 1 dimension and multiple dimensions, and both for pure and mixed strategies (see ```1D_equilibria_finder```, ```nD_equilibria_finder``` and ```2player_mixed_equilibrium_finder```). Some of the results are in the .npy files, for use in other code (such as ```election_US_20```).
